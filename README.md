# Description
This project is a practical introduction to the fundamentals of computer **networking**.
The goal is to configure small-scale networks through a dedicated training interface, ensuring proper communication between various devices.

Throughout the 10 levels of exercises, I have learned to:
- **IP Addressing**: Assign and manage TCP/IP addresses effectively.
- **Subnetting**: Understand how subnet masks define network boundaries and host range.
- **Routing & Switching**: Configure routers and switches to direct traffic between different segments.
- **Gateways**: Implement default gateways to allow communication with external networks.

The project focuses on solving non-functioning network diagrams by identifying configuration errors,
such as invalid IP ranges, missing routes, or incorrect masks, and correcting them to achieve specific connectivity goals.
